# Italy's 2016 and 2021 elections.

Since 1993, Italians vote for mayors and city councils' renewals. Those local governing bodies stay in charge for a five-year term, but they can be disbanded beforehand under precise causes defined by law.

The limitation to only two electoral turnout is due to my shiny's server limited resources. However, the database could be extended to the whole data available.
