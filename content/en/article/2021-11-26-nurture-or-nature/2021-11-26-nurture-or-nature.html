<h3>2. Calculate the mean and standard deviations of the variables mom_iq and kid_score simultaneously</h3>
<p>For calculating the mean and the standard deviations simultaneously, I’ll the function <em>summarise</em> and <em>across</em> from <em>dplyr</em> package:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>kidiq %&gt;% 
  summarise(across(
    .cols = c(kid_score, mom_iq),
    .fns = list(mean = mean, sd = sd), na.rm = T,
    .names = &quot;{col}_{fn}&quot;

## 1       86.79724     20.41069         100        15</code></pre>
<p>The summarizing table shows that the mothers obtained a little higher IQ score compared to kids’ ones. Furthermore, mothers’ Standard Deviation is 25% smaller than kids’ SD, showing a smaller dispersion in the kids’ scores.</p>

<div id="scatter-plot-of-mom_iq-and-kid_score" class="section level3">
<h3>3. Scatter plot of mom_iq and kid_score</h3>
<p>I’ll make the plots using the <em>ggplot</em> package, using <em>geom_point</em> and <em>geom_smooth</em> functions:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = kidiq, aes(x = mom_iq, y = kid_score))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(se = F)+
  labs(title = &quot;Relationship between Mother&#39;s IQ and Kid&#39;s scores&quot;)+
  ylab(&quot;Kid score&quot;)+
  xlab(&quot;Mother iq&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>The scatter plot, with a local regression line, shows a slightly positive correlation between mothers’ IQ and kids’ scores.</p>
</div>
<div id="boxplot-of-the-variable-kid_score-by-the-variable-mom_hs" class="section level3">
<h3>4. Boxplot of the variable kid_score by the variable mom_hs</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = kidiq, aes(x= as.factor(mom_hs), y = kid_score))+
  geom_boxplot(fill=c(&quot;#665191&quot;,&quot;#ff7c43&quot;))+
  scale_x_discrete(labels= c(&quot;No&quot;,&quot;Yes&quot;))+
  ylab(&quot;Kid score&quot;)+

<p>The boxplot shows that kids whose mothers completed High School obtain an averagely higher score than kids whose mothers have not finished High School. Moreover, the latter category has a higher sample dispersion.</p>

<div id="recoding-of-mothers-age-and-mean-of-kid_score-by-mom_age_gr-and-mom_hs" class="section level3">
<h3>5. Recoding of mothers’ age and mean of kid_score by mom_age_gr and mom_hs</h3>
<p>For recoding <strong>mom_age</strong> variable we can use the <em>mutate</em> function, from <em>dplyr</em>, and <em>cut</em> function from base R:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>kidiq &lt;- kidiq %&gt;% 
  mutate(mom_age_gr = cut(mom_age,
             breaks=c(16,21,25,30),
             labels = c(&quot;17-21&quot;,&quot;22-25&quot;,&quot;26-29&quot;)))</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>kidiq %&gt;% 
  group_by(mom_age_gr, mom_hs) %&gt;% 
  summarise(kid_score_mean = mean(kid_score, na.rm = T))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 × 3
## # Groups:   mom_age_gr [3]
##   mom_age_gr mom_hs kid_score_mean
##   &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 17-21           0           81.5
## 2 17-21           1           86.1
## 3 22-25           0           73.8
## 4 22-25           1           90.0
## 5 26-29           0           71.1
## 6 26-29           1           92.2</code></pre>
<p>The resulting single row data frame displayed shows us that in the older groups there was more difference in the scores obtained by kids whose mothers finished High School and kids whose mothers did not. In the youngest groups that difference is, for the most part, reduced.</p>

<h3>6. Plot showing the relationship between mom_iq and kid_score by the variable mom_hs</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>kidiq %&gt;%

    ) %&gt;%

  geom_point(aes(shape = mom_hs_d, col = mom_hs_d, alpha = 0.5),show.legend = F)+
  geom_smooth(aes(col= mom_hs_d), method = &quot;lm&quot;)+
  scale_color_manual(values = c(&quot;#665191&quot;,&quot;#ff7c43&quot;), &quot;Mother&#39;s school completion&quot;)+

<p>The two linear regression lines show that the relation between mothers’ IQ and kids’ scores in the two groups differ slightly: in the group of kids whose mothers didn’t finish High School, the linear regression is more positive tilted compared to the other group. That suggests a stronger correlation between the Mothers’ IQ and kids’ obtained scores in that group.</p>
