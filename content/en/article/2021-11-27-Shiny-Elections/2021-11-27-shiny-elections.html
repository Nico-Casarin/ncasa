<h1>Italy’s 2016 and 2021 elections.</h1>
<p>Since 1993, Italians vote for mayors and city councils’ renewals. Those local governing bodies stay in charge for a five-year term, but they can be disbanded beforehand under precise causes defined by law.</p>
<p>The limitation to only two electoral turnout is due to my shiny’s server limited resources. However, the database could be extended to the whole data available.</p>
